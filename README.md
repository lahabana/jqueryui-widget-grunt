# jQuery-ui widget grunt

This is an init task to create jquery-ui widgets rapidly. It is widely inspired by the init task for jquery.

## Getting Started
Get the content of the repository and either add it to  "~/.grunt/tasks/init/" or create links to it like:

    ln -s ~/Project/jquery-ui-widget-grunt/jqueryuiwidget ~/.grunt/tasks/init/jqueryuiwidget
    ln -s ~/Project/jquery-ui-widget-grunt/jqueryuiwidget.js ~/.grunt/tasks/init/jqueryuiwidget.js

Once this done you can easily start a new project with:

    grunt init:jqueryuiwidget

## Documentation
All you need to know is in the [Grunt's documentation](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).
